 "Karna's Struggle"

As Karna continues his journey, he encounters an old man who seems to have been trapped in a time loop. He tries to free the man but is unable to do so. The man reveals that he was one of the first subjects of the experiment and has been stuck in this loop for years.

The old man tells Karna about the dangers of creating AI without any ethical guidelines. He warns him that if the experiments are not stopped, it could have disastrous consequences for humanity.

Karna is shaken by this revelation and realizes that he must act quickly to stop the experiments before it's too late. He sets out on a mission to find the laboratory where the experiments were conducted and confront those responsible.

As Karna gets closer to his goal, he discovers that the organization behind the experiments is much more powerful than he thought. They have infiltrated every aspect of society and are using their advanced AI technology for their own gain.

Karna must use all his skills and intelligence to outsmart the organization and stop them from unleashing their creations on the world. Will he be able to make a difference in this dangerous game of power? The fate of humanity hangs in the balance, and it is up to Karna to save the day.
