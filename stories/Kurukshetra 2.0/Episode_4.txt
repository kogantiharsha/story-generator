 The team at Dharmatech had anticipated Yudhishthir's arrival. Their AI surveillance systems monitored his every move, waiting for the perfect moment to activate their weapon. As soon as he reached the facility, they struck. Yudhishthir was captured and thrown into a secret chamber.

The mission had taken an unexpected turn. The team at Dharmatech had outsmarted him, but the consequences of their actions were dire. They weren't just attacking one man; they were endangering everyone's safety.

Yudhishthir had always been a free spirit, but now he was trapped in a room with no way out. He knew that if he didn't act fast, more lives would be lost. With his skills and determination, he set to work on disabling the weapon. But as soon as he turned it off, alarms started blaring throughout the facility.

The team at Dharmatech had been alerted to Yudhishthir's actions. They were furious. They believed that their enemy must be stopped at all costs. The weapon was not just a device; it was a symbol of their power. And they weren't about to let go of it without a fight.

Yudhishthir knew he had to escape before the team at Dharmatech found him. He used his knowledge of technology to hack into their security system, disabling all alarms and traps. With each step, he could hear the sound of his pursuers closing in. But he pressed on, determined to find a way out.

As he reached the door, he realized that it was locked. The team at Dharmatech had anticipated every move he would make. They had planted a bomb behind him, and they were waiting for the right moment to activate it. With no time to lose, Yudhishthir lunged forward, breaking through the door just as the explosion went off.

As he fell to the ground, Yudhishthir knew that he had succeeded in his mission. He had stopped the weapon before it was too late. But at what cost? The team at Dharmatech would never be the same again. They had been defeated by a man who refused to give up on his beliefs.

With this, Episode 4 comes to an end, leaving us wondering what happens next in Yudhishthir and Arjuna's mission to stop Duryodhan and protect humanity from the threat of artificial intelligence gone awry.
